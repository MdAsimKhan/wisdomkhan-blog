                wisdomkhan is the pen name of Mohammad Asim Khan. I have been writng since 2018 or when I was in class 10th. At first. I started with school assignments such as essays and letters. And when my teacher prasied me and liked my writing when compared to others,
                I started to improve it even more. I bought a thick grammar bok and read it and oslved it all. This was also because English had always been the weak point of every student. To get a good percentage in class 1oth borads, I had to score
                equally well in all the subjects and since english was on high alert and also my new favourite, I started working on it diligently. I scored 94 in English that year. I also had a friend who was my inspiration to write. I usually wrote
                poems of romantic genre. This continued forever and I also wrote short stories on love and a few children stories as well. We used to chat on social media in english and even my self-talk was in english. These two factors helped me a lot
                in improving my english. I scored 98 in class 12th finals. This was it for the school life. Now, I started writing articles and blogs as well. And thus, here you are, reading all of my poems, articles and quotes.

                My friend who was my inspiration parted with me. She taught me many lessons whihc again inspired me to read self-help books collecting wisdom from everywhere I found. Thus, I read a lot of wise teachings and saying and therefore developed a wisdom of
                my own. Soon I started to observe that most people around me do not share wiht me the knowledge of a noble and wise life whihc I had. Thus, I realised that I am the wise one, say enlightenmentdawned upon me by my own observations. This
                gave birth to span wisdomkhan.
